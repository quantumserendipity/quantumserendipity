- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @quantumserendipity an ageing systems and software engineer based in the Redlands, near Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Retro computing especially BBC Micro and Apple IIe as well as electronics and 3d printing. I play with small electronics projects and am currently integrating my BBC micro via a raspbeerry pi to my slot car track.  The goal would be to have the car drive autonomously around the track with varied speeds accordingly. The problem is quite interesting as the car would (somehow) have to map the track  and know where on the track it is. Further ideas are to add some kind of traction control and allow the car to go as fast as possible. If possible all controlled by the old 8 bit micro. :-)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python for the Raspberry Pi.
